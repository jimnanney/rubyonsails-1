    p Ruby On Sails is an event not woth missing. You and you friends can come join us the day before the RubyConf kickoff and spend a morning chartering a sailboat on the Atlantic. Our priority is to get individuals with technical passion for Ruby together for an experience you won’t soon forget. We have everything arranged, now we just need you. We’re taking multiple boats out for a day of non-stop awesome fun.  We'll have the kickoff event to start your conference off right. Our sponsors below have covered most of the cost. We'll ask a modest $20 per person to cover the after cookout, so grab your sunscreen, your bathing suits, and your friends, and lets do this.
