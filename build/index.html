November 7th, 2013.</h2><p>Ruby On Sails is an event not worth missing. You and your friends can come join us the day before the RubyConf kickoff and spend a morning chartering a sailboat on the Atlantic. Our priority is to get individuals with technical passion for Ruby together for an experience you won’t soon forget. We have everything arranged, now we just need you. We’re taking multiple boats out for a day of non-stop awesome fun.  We'll have the kickoff event to start your conference off right. Our sponsors below have covered most of the cost. We'll ask a modest $20 per person to cover the after cookout, so grab your sunscreen, your bathing suits, and your friends, and lets do this. Registration will open after RubyConf registration has opened. We cant wait to see you this November!</p><p><a href="http://rubyconf.org" target="_blank">RubyConf</a> is put on by the fine folks at <a href="http://rubycentral.org" target="_blank">Ruby Central</a> and are not affilliated with us.  We are entirely separate entities.  They do a wonderful job of putting on Ruby Conferences all over, and we simply are having a kickoff event the day before RubyConf. See you all in November!</p></div></div><h3>RUBY ON SAILS SPONSORS</h3><div class="sponsors"><a href="http://neo.com" target="_blank"><div class="neo"></div></a></div><footer><p>&copy Ruby On Sails 2013.
